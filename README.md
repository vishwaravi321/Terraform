# Terraform Configuration for Hetzner Cloud

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform configuration files to manage infrastructure on Hetzner Cloud. The provided configurations include a basic setup for deploying a server with custom parameters.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) 1.0 or higher
- Hetzner Cloud account and API token

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vishwaravi321/Terraform.git your-rep
cd your-rep
```

### 2. Configure Your Variables

Change `terraform.tfvars` file with necessary variables:

```hcl
hcloud_token  = "your_hetzner_cloud_api_token"
name          = "server-name"
image         = "ubuntu-20.04"
server_type   = "cax11"
location      = "fsn1"
ssh_key        = "your_ssh_key_name"
```

**Note:** Ensure that you replace placeholder values with your actual Hetzner Cloud API token and other configuration values.

### 3. Update Locations and Images

Hetzner Cloud frequently updates available locations and images. Periodically check the [Hetzner Cloud API documentation](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/) for the latest information and update the `location` and `image` variables in your `terraform.tfvars` file accordingly.

### 4. Initialize Terraform

Run the following command to initialize the Terraform configuration. This will download the necessary provider plugins:

```sh
terraform init
```

### 5. Plan Your Infrastructure

Generate an execution plan to see what changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure:

```sh
terraform plan
```

### 6. Apply the Configuration

Apply the configuration to create or update resources in your Hetzner Cloud account:

```sh
terraform apply
```

### 7. View Output

After applying the configuration, you can view the output variables (such as the server's IP address) with:

```sh
terraform output
```

## Directory Structure

- `variables.tf`: File defining the input variables for the Terraform configuration.
- `terraform.tfvars`: File where you specify values for the variables.
